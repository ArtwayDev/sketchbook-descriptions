The Artway STUDIO Spiral Bound Sketchbook is a high-quality product designed for creative individuals who value superior paper and a landscape orientation. Its A3 size makes it perfect for capturing expansive scenes, while the 170gsm weight ensures durability and resistance to ink bleed-through. The spiral binding allows for easy flipping of pages, making it convenient for quick sketches or detailed drawings. Manufactured by the trusted brand ARTWAY, this A3 Landscape Sketchbook guarantees excellent paper quality and is a must-have for artists, illustrators, and students looking to showcase their artistic talents in a professional manner.

Our drawing books also have sufficient tooth (surface texture) for general art and design applications, suitable for light washes. Slight buckling will occur when using watercolours and inks

The ring binding allows you to add additional material to the drawing pad or to easily remove pages. We recommend manually closing the wire loops on a regular basis to stop the book from loosening, particularly if you have pages with added material.

This classically styled spiralbound Studio A3 Landscape sketch book is made from grey board covered with black Wibalin cloth (which restricts warping), and a premium heavyweight 170gsm cartridge paper. The spiral binding is silver

This premium plain paper small artist sketchpad is ideal for sketching ideas or presenting work. It also works well as a scrapbook!
